##Input the values of a and b as 10 and 20 respectively. Now check if a is greater or b is greater using if condition. Think about all the edge cases, and print the statements accordingly

#Input numbers

a = float(input("Enter first number: "))
b = float(input("Enter second number: "))

#Find the greater number

if a>b:
    print(f"{a} is grater than {b}")
else:
    print(f"{b} is grater than {a}")
